# meta-schema

Library designed to help with data processing using `clojure.spec`.

The idea is to provide an user the ability to combine
several pre-coded `clojure.spec` into some specific shape at
*runtime*.


## Usage

In your project you need to define EDN files inside your
resource folder and provide the name of this folder in
`(setup! ..)`. These files should be simple and describe the
location and intent of your pre-defined specs.

```clj
{:zipcode {:intent "Validation to ZipCodes in Brazil"
           :location :my-project.spec/zipcode-br}
 :money {:intent "How we understand money around here? Anything >= 0 either long, float, double, or decimal"
         :location :my-project.other-spec/money-br}
}
```

Make sure that all this namespaces are loaded before invoke
`meta-schema.core/setup!`.


Example of specification provided to the library at runtime.

```clj
  (require '[meta-schema.core :as ms])
  (require '[clojure.alpha.spec :as s])

  (ms/setup! "my-specs")

  (def file-spec {:valores [{:spec :cnpj
                             :optional? false
                             :nullable? false}
                            {:treta {:spec :letras
                                     :nullable? true}
                             :total {:spec :numero
                                     :optional? true}}]

                  :celular {:spec :cnpj
                            :optional? true
                            :nullable? true}

                  :bairro {:numero [{:letreiro {:agora {:spec :letras
                                                        :optional? true}}}]
                           :federal {:spec :cnpj
                                     :optional? false}}
                  :casa {:spec :numero
                         :optional? true}})

  (def my-parser (ms/create-parser file-spec))
  (s/valid? my-parser my-data)

```
